# Geneva's Humanitarian Big Data

Understanding (big) data with machine-learning. A half-day workshop introducing
techniques for making sense of large datasets.

By the end you will know:

* the basics of [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* how to use Decision Trees and Random Forests
* how to use cross-validation to measure performance
* that there are many metrics by which to measure performance
